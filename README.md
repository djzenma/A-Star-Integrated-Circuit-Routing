# A-Star-Routing


## A Star Algorithm for Routing cells' pins using Metal 1, Metal 2, and Metal 3 wires.

com.AStar class contains the actual functions needed for the A* algorithm to work. It uses the com.Node class.

com.Maze class is an interface between the main and the com.AStar class. I have done it to abstract details from the com.AStar class.

## To use it:
Run the code from the GUI/Main.class using your favorite IDE or command interpreter.
The result will be displayed on a beautiful simple GUI once you don't want to enter new cells.
