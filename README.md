# A-Star-Routing

## A Star Algorithm for Routing cells' pins using Metal 1, Metal 2, and Metal 3 wires.

AStar class contains the actual functions needed for the A* algorithm to work. It uses the Node class.

Maze class is an interface between the main and the AStar class. I have done it to abstract details from the AStar class.

Working on the GUI.
